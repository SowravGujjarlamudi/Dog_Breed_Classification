# Dog Breed Classification
This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub.

## 1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

## 2. Data
The data using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

## 3. Evaluation
The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

## 4. Features
Some information about the data:

* The dataset contains images (unstructured data) so it's probably use deep learning/transfer learning.
* There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).


## 5. GUI
* GUI is build for user friendly.
